## Running / Testing the Website Locally (Recommended)

To more accurately look at the website while developing (and to ensure root-relative paths like `/css/styles.css` behave the same as they will on GitHub Pages), run a local server from the **repo root**.

### Start the server
1. Open a terminal and `cd` into the repository folder (the one that contains `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, and `assets/`).
2. Run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### View the site
Open these in your browser:
Home: http://localhost:8000/
Example subpage: http://localhost:8000/projects/

### Stop the server
Press Ctrl + C in the terminal window where the server is running.
